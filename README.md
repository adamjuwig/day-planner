# day-planner

The purpose of this project was to create a simple day planner using jQuery and the moment.js libray.
Using jQuery, the app loops through the hours of 9 am to 5 pm. The current time and current day are handled by moment.js. The user can enter in specific events throughout the day, which are color coded. Past events are gray blocks, green for future events, and red for the current time of day. These events are saved to localStorage and will not be erased when the page is refreshed.
